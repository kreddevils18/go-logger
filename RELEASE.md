# Release Process

This project publishes releases automatically via a GitHub Action when a tag starting with `v` is pushed.

## Steps

1. Ensure that the `master` branch contains all desired changes and that tests pass locally.
2. Create an annotated tag for the new version:

   ```bash
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

3. Pushing the tag triggers the workflow defined in `.github/workflows/release.yml`. The workflow:
   - Checks out the repository with full history.
   - Sets up Go 1.21.
   - Runs `go test ./...` to verify the build.
   - Creates a GitHub release using `softprops/action-gh-release` with autogenerated notes.
   - Notifies the Go module proxy so `go get` can download the new version.

When the workflow completes, the release will appear on the GitHub Releases page and can be fetched via `go get github.com/kreddevils18/go-logger@vX.Y.Z`.
